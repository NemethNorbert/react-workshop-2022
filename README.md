# Goal

We are going to create an Euro BTC converter application

## Week 1

1. Add a number input with a label, "Euros".
2. Extract the input into a separate component called <Amount /> that takes a name (eg. "Euros") prop.
3. Teach <Amount /> input to show a red outline for negative amounts.
4. Make <Amount /> a controlled component (ie. pass it its value as a prop).
5. Add a second, read-only <Amount /> component that shows $BTC instead of Euros; use this function to get the exchange rate:
```javascript
    function exchangeRate() {
      return Math.random() * 10000;
    }
```
6. Use setTimeout to make the $BTC price crash to zero after 5 seconds of inactivity.
7. Use React.createContext() to provide a dark/light theme toggle.
